That's right. Then I was assigned...
- This is fucking great.
- ..under John Connor.
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...
Goddamn! Sorry.
..built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.
I see.

Shot :965
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

Shot :966
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

Shot :967
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

Shot :968
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

Shot :969


Shot :970
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

Shot :971


Shot :972
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.
Well, how are you supposed to get back?
I can't.

Shot :973


Shot :974
It's just him and me.

Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

It doesn't require a shred of proof.

He's crazy?
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

Shot :1022


Shot :1023


Shot :1024


Shot :1025
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

Shot :1026
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

Shot :1027


Shot :1028
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.
- I can't sleep.
- Try.
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

You must survive or I will never exist.
That's all.
It's a good field dressing.
You like it?
It's my first.

Shot :1195
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
OK.
Talk to me some more.
About what?
Tell me about where you're from.

Shot :1196
All right.

You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

Thank you.
Is this enough?
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

Shot :1307
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

Keep this.

No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.
I need to know where to reach you.

Shot :1312
I am worried sick here.
OK. OK, here's the number.
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.
It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.

What's for dinner?

Shot :1317
What is it?
It's a nitroglycerin base.

He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.

Shot :1321
It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me. I'm shaking.
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.
No, I'm not.
