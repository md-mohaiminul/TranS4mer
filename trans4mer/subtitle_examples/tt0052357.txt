Tomorrow? The corset
comes off tomorrow.
I'll be able to scratch myself
like anybody else tomorrow.
I'll throw this miserable
thing out the window.
Be a free...
I'll be a free man.
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

Shot :35


Shot :36
What, do you know that
from personal experience or...

Shot :37
What happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?

Shot :38
You sound so
disapproving, Midge.

Shot :39


Shot :40
he was going to be
chief of police someday.

Shot :41


Shot :42
Well, it's because of
this fear of heights
I have, this acrophobia.
I wake up at night seeing
that man fall from the roof,

Shot :43


Shot :44
I know. That's what
everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors
explained to you...
I know, I know.
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo,
and I get dizzy.
Boy! What a moment
to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it,
and there's no losing it.

Shot :45


Shot :46
You mean,
and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?
Where you belong.
What about my acrophobia?
What about...
Now suppose I'm sitting in
this chair, behind the desk.
Here's the desk.
And a pencil falls
from the desk
down to the floor,
and I reach down to pick up
the pencil. Bingo!
My acrophobia's back.

Shot :47
Oh, Johnny-O.

Shot :48
Well, I'm not gonna
do anything for a while.
You know, don't forget,
I'm a man of independent
means, as the saying goes.

Shot :49
Mmm-hmm.

Shot :50
You mean, to forget?

Shot :56
Midge, the music.
Don't you think
it's sort of...

Shot :57
Oh.
What's this doohickey?
It's a brassiere.
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.
I've never run across
one like that.
It's brand-new.
Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps,
no back straps,
but does everything
a brassiere should do.
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.
It does?
Mmm-hmm.
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula
designed it.
He worked it out
in his spare time.
Kind of a hobby.
A do-it-yourself
type of thing.

Shot :58
That's following
a train of thought.

Shot :59
Well...

Shot :60
Normal.
Aren't you ever
gonna get married?

Shot :61


Shot :62


Shot :63
Good old college days.

Shot :64


Shot :65
Oh, Midge, do you remember
a fellow in college
by the name of Gavin Elster?

Shot :66
Gavin Elster?
Yes, funny name.
You think I would. No.

Shot :67
I got a call from Gavin today.
It's funny, he sort of dropped
out of sight during the war.

Shot :68


Shot :69


Shot :70


Shot :71
Could be.
He's probably on the bum,
and wants to touch you
for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum.
I'll buy him a couple drinks
and tell him my troubles.

Shot :72


Shot :73
Well, then,
I think I'll go home.
Midge, what'd you mean,
"There's no losing it"?
What?
The acrophobia.
I asked my doctor.
He said that only another
emotional shock could do it
and probably wouldn't.
You're not gonna go
diving off another
rooftop to find out?
I think I can lick it.
Well, how?
I have a theory.
I have a theory. I think
if I can get used to heights,
just a little bit at a time,
just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?
I'll show you what I mean.
Here. I'll show you
what I mean.
We'll start with this.
That?
What do you want me to start
with, the Golden Gate Bridge?
Now, watch.
Watch this. Here we go.
There. There.
Now, I look up,
I look down.
I look up.
All right, there's
nothing to it.
You're kidding.

Shot :74
Here.
That's a girl.
I'll use that.
Put it right there.
All right, here's
the first step.

Shot :75
Okay, now step number two.

Shot :76


Shot :77


Shot :78
There we are.
See? I look up,
I look down,
I look up...

Shot :79


Shot :80


Shot :81
No problem.

Shot :82


Shot :83


Shot :84
I look up, I look down.

Shot :85


Shot :86


Shot :87


Shot :88
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.
How did you get
in the shipbuilding
business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Very interesting business.

Shot :89
Well, you don't have to
do it for a living.
No, but one assumes
responsibilities.
My wife's family
is all gone.
Someone has to look
after her interests.
Her father's partner
runs the company yard
in the East, Baltimore.
So I decided, as long
as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.
I've always
liked it here.
How long have you
been back?
Almost a year.
You like it, huh?
Well, San Francisco's
changed.
The things that spell
San Francisco to me
are disappearing fast.

Shot :90
Like all these.

Shot :91


Shot :92


Shot :93


Shot :94
No. No, I'm all right.

Shot :95


Shot :96
Is it a permanent
physical disability?

Shot :97


Shot :98


Shot :99


Shot :100


Shot :101


Shot :102
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a little early
in the day for me.
Well, I guess that just
about covers everything,
doesn't it?

Shot :103


Shot :104
I'm a retired detective,
and you're in the
shipbuilding business.

Shot :105
I asked you to come up here,
Scottie, knowing that
you'd quit detective work.
But I wondered whether
you'd go back on the job
as a special favor to me.
I want you
to follow my wife.
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.
Well, then...
I'm afraid some harm
may come to her.
From whom?

Shot :106
Scottie, do you
believe that someone
out of the past,
someone dead, can enter
and take possession
of a living being?
No.
If I told you that I believe
this has happened to my wife,
what would you say?

Shot :107
Well, I'd say take her to
the nearest psychiatrist,
or psychologist,
or neurologist, or psycho...
Or maybe just
the plain family doctor.
I'd have him
check on you, too.

Shot :108
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

Shot :109
Thanks for coming in,
Scottie.
Okay.

Shot :110
No, it sounds idiotic,
I know.
And you're still
the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?
Always were.
Do you think
I'm making it up?
No.
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.
She'll be talking to me
about something.
Suddenly, the words
fade into silence.

Shot :111


Shot :112
She's somewhere else,
away from me,
someone I don't know.

Shot :113


Shot :114
Then, with a long sigh,
she's back,

Shot :115
Can't tell me
where or when.
Well, how often
does this happen?
More and more
in the past few weeks.
And she wanders.
God knows
where she wanders.

Shot :116
I followed her one day,

Shot :117


Shot :118
Got into her car and drove
out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

Shot :119
Sat by the lake,

Shot :120
You know, Portals of the Past.
Sat there a long time,
without moving.

Shot :121


Shot :122
She said she'd driven out
to Golden Gate Park and
sat by the lake, that's all.

Shot :123


Shot :124
The speedometer on her car
showed that she'd driven
94 miles.

Shot :125
Where did she go?

Shot :126
I've gotta know, Scottie,
where she goes
and what she does
before I get involved
with doctors.
Well, have you talked
to the doctors at all,
about that?
Yes, but carefully.
I want to know more
before committing her
to that kind of care.

Shot :127


Shot :128
They're dependable,
good boys.

Shot :129
Look, this isn't my line.

Shot :130
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.
I'm in a panic about this.

Shot :131
I'm supposed to be retired.
I don't want to get mixed up
in this darn thing.
Look, we're going
to an opening
at the opera tonight.
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.
Ernie's.

Oh, that's Carlotta.
You'll find it
in the catalog.
Portrait of Carlotta.
May I have this?
Yes.
Thank you.

Is there something
I can do for you?
Yes. You run this hotel?
Oh, yes.
Would you tell me who has
the room on the second floor
in the corner, that corner?
Oh, I'm afraid
we couldn't give out
information of that sort.
Our clients are
entitled to their privacy,
you know.
And I do believe
it's against the law.

Shot :281


Shot :282
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that
sweet girl with that
dear face...
What's her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.
Spanish, you know.

Shot :283
Yeah, that's it.

Shot :284
How long has she
had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here, ever?

Shot :285


Shot :286
But I must say...
When she comes down,
don't say that
I've been here.
Oh, but she hasn't
been here today.
I just saw her come in
five minutes ago.
No, she hasn't
been here at all.
Well, I would have
seen her, you know.
I've been right here all
the time, putting olive oil
on my rubber plant leaves.

Shot :287


Shot :288
Well, would you
please go up and look?
To her room?
That's right.
Yes, of course,
if you ask.
But it does seem silly.
Thank you.

That's the kind of
greeting a girl likes.
None of this, "Hello,
you look wonderful," stuff.
Just a good straight,
"Who do you know that's an
authority on San Francisco..."

Shot :305


Shot :306


Shot :307
No, no, I don't mean
that kind of history.

Shot :308
Oh.
Well, you mean
the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

Shot :309


Shot :310
Pop Leibel.
Who?

Shot :311
Why, what do you
want to know?

Shot :312
Hey, wait a minute.

Shot :313
You know him well?
Who?
Pop Leibel.
Oh, sure.

Shot :314
I don't need a hat.

Shot :315
Hey.
Wait a minute.

Shot :316
Hello. Yes,
I remember. Carlotta.
The beautiful Carlotta.
The sad Carlotta.
What does an old
wooden house at the corner
of Eddy and Gough Street
have to do with
Carlotta Valdes?
Well, it was hers.
It was built for her
many years ago.
By whom?
By...
By...
No. The name,
I do not remember.
A rich man,
a powerful man.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.

Shot :317
It is not an unusual story.
She came from somewhere small
to the south of the city.

Shot :318
Young, yes.
Very young.
And she was found
dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man.

Shot :319
in the Western Addition.

Shot :320


Shot :321


Shot :322
I cannot tell you
exactly how much
time passed,
or how much happiness
there was.
But, then,
he threw her away.
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.
So he kept the child
and threw her away.
You know, a man could
do that in those days.
They had the power
and the freedom.
And she became
the sad Carlotta.
Alone in the great house,
walking the streets alone.
Her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.
And the mad Carlotta.
Stopping people
in the streets to ask,
"Where is my child?
"Have you seen my child?"
Poor thing.
And she died.
She died.
How?
By her own hand.
There are many
such stories.
Well, thank you very much.
You are welcome.
I appreciate it.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

Shot :323
Now then, Johnny-O,
pay me.
For what?
For bringing you here.
Come on, tell.
There's nothing to tell.
You'll tell or you'll
be back in that corset.
Come on, Johnny, please.
Come on, come on.
I'll take you home.

Shot :324
There we are.
You haven't told me
everything.
No, I've told you enough.
Who's the guy
and who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one that phoned,
your old college chum, Elster.
Midge, out, please.
And the idea is
that the beautiful,
mad Carlotta has come
back from the dead
and taken possession
of Elster's wife.
Now, Johnny, really.
Come on.
Well, I'm not telling you
what I think. I'm telling
you what he thinks.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I...
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta.
Elster's wife.
Yes.
I guess you'd consider
that she would be...
I think I'll go take
a look at that portrait.
Good-bye.
Midge...
Good-bye.
Midge, you...

Shot :325


Shot :326
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
There are things
you didn't tell me.
I didn't know
where she'd lead you.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yeah.
You notice the way
she does her hair?
You know,
there's something else.
My wife, Madeleine,
has several pieces of jewelry
that belonged to Carlotta.
She inherited them.
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.
Until now.
Now, when she's alone,
she takes them out
and looks at them,
handles them gently,
curiously.
Puts them on
and stares at herself
in the mirror.
And goes into
that other world,
is someone else again.
Now, Carlotta Valdes
was what?
Your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother.
Now, the child
who was taken from her,
whose loss drove Carlotta
mad and to her death,
was Madeleine's grandmother.
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdes home.
Well, I think
that explains it.

Shot :327


Shot :328
She knows nothing of a grave
out at the Mission Dolores?

Shot :329


Shot :330


Shot :331


Shot :332


Shot :333
Her mother told me
most of them
before she died.

Shot :334
Why wouldn't
she tell her daughter?

Shot :335
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

At old Fort Point,
out at the Presidio.

Shot :404


Shot :405
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there,
especially at sunset.

Shot :426
Oh, the pins, yes.
Right in here.
I'll get them for you.
And my purse, please.

Shot :427
Here you are.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have
brought me here,
you know.

Shot :428
You could have
looked in my car.

Shot :429
No, I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

Shot :430
No, you're right.

Shot :431


Shot :432


Shot :433
My name is
Madeleine Elster.

Shot :434


Shot :435
Oh, John, mostly.

Shot :436


Shot :437
Oh, gee whiz,
I wouldn't like that.
Oh, no.
And after what happened this
afternoon, I should think
maybe you'd call me Scottie.
Maybe even John.
I prefer John.
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?
One shouldn't live alone.

Shot :438
No, it's wrong.

Shot :439
Will you tell me something?

Shot :440


Shot :441


Shot :442
Oh.
No. No, it's never
happened before.

Shot :443


Shot :444


Shot :445


Shot :446


Shot :447
No, it's the first time
for me, too.
Here, I'll get you
some more coffee.

Shot :448


Shot :449
Hello?
Scottie, what happened?
She's not home yet.
No, she's all right.
She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.
Oh, what happened?
She went into the Bay.
Hello? Hello?
Did she hurt herself?
No, she's going to be
in fine shape. There's
nothing to worry about.
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?
She doesn't know
what happened.
Scottie, Madeleine is 26.
Carlotta Valdes
committed suicide
when she was 26.
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

Shot :513
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?
No. No, thank you.
Well, I couldn't mail it.
I didn't know your address,
but I had a landmark.
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

How old?
Oh, some 2,000 years or more.
The oldest
living things.
Yes.
You've never
been here before?
No.
What are
you thinking?
Of all the people who've
been born and have died,
while the trees
went on living.
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living."
I don't like them.
Why?

Shot :538


Shot :539


Shot :540
Here's a cross section of one of the old
trees that's been cut down.

Shot :541


Shot :542


Shot :543


Shot :544


Shot :545
Somewhere in here,
I was born,
and there I died.
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.

Madeleine,
where are you now?
Here with you.
Where?
Tall trees...
Have you
been here before?
Yes.
When?
When were you born?
Long ago.
Where?
When? Tell me.
Madeleine, tell me.
No!
Madeleine, tell me
what it is.
Where do you go?
What takes you away?
No, I can't tell you.
When you jumped
into the bay, you didn't
know where you were.
You guessed,
but you didn't know.
I didn't jump.
I didn't jump. I fell.
You told me I fell.
Why did you jump?
Why did you jump?
I can't tell you.
Why did you jump?
What was there inside
that told you to jump?
No, please. Please.
What? What?
Please don't ask me.
Please don't ask me.
Take me away from here.
Shall I take you home?
Somewhere in the light.
Promise me something.
Promise you won't
ask me again.
Please promise me that.

Shot :560


Shot :561


Shot :562


Shot :563


Shot :564
Why did you run?
I'm responsible
for you now.
You know, the Chinese say
that once you've saved
a person's life,
you're responsible
for it forever,
so I'm committed.
I have to know.

Shot :565


Shot :566
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor

Shot :567


Shot :568
And when I come to the end
of the corridor,
there's nothing but darkness.
And I know that when
I walk into the darkness,

Shot :569
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back
before then.
Except once.

Shot :570
Yesterday?
And you didn't know.
You didn't know
what happened
till you found
yourself with me.

Shot :571
But the small scenes,
the fragments of the mirror,
you remember those.

Shot :572


Shot :573


Shot :574


Shot :575
A grave.

Shot :576
Where?

Shot :577


Shot :578


Shot :579
I know.

Shot :580


Shot :581


Shot :582
This part is a dream.
I think.

Shot :583


Shot :584
It seems to be in Spain,
a village in Spain.

Shot :585


Shot :586


Shot :587


Shot :588
So, explain it away?

Shot :589


Shot :590


Shot :591


Shot :592


Shot :593
Madeleine!

Shot :594
Oh, Scottie!
I'm not mad!
I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.
Oh, Scottie,
don't let me go.
I'm here.
I've got you.
I'm so afraid.
Don't leave me.
Stay with me.
All the time.

Shot :595
Hi, Johnny.
Hi.
Did you get my message?

Shot :596
I'll get you a drink.
Okay.
Since when do you
go around slipping notes
under men's doors?

Shot :597
For a man who has nothing
to do, you're certainly
a busy little bee.

Shot :598


Shot :599
Where?
Round about.

Shot :600
Oh.
What was this...

Shot :601
All I said in my note was,
"Where are you?"

Shot :602


Shot :603
Well, I just thought
that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner,

Shot :604


Shot :605


Shot :606


Shot :607
Only if you want to.

Shot :608


Shot :609


Shot :610


Shot :611
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.
Oh, I've been having
a wonderful time.
I've gone back
to my first love,
painting.
Well, good for you.
I always said you were
wasting your time in the
underwear department.
You know, it's a living.
But I'm really excited
about this.

Shot :612


Shot :613
Hmm. Yeah.

Shot :614


Shot :615


Shot :616


Shot :617


Shot :618
It's not funny, Midge.
Johnny!
No.
Johnny, I just thought...
Uh-uh.
No.

Shot :619


Shot :620


Shot :621
Johnny!
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!
Idiot!

Shot :622


Shot :623
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

Shot :624
Madeleine!
What's the matter?
What time is it?
I should have phoned you,
but I wanted to see you
and be with you.
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.
Now, now, it's gonna
be all right.
It'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you
some brandy.
Just drink this down.
Here, just like medicine.

Shot :625
There now.

Shot :626


Shot :627


Shot :628
It was the tower again,
and the bell,
and the old Spanish village.
Yes?
Clear, so very clear
for the first time.
All of it.
Tell me.

Shot :629


Shot :630


Shot :631
with a porch and shutters
and a balcony above,
a small garden,
and next to it
a livery stable
with old carriages
lined up inside.

Shot :632


Shot :633
with a lovely pepper tree
at the corner.

Shot :641
Madeleine, a hundred miles
south of San Francisco,
there's an old
Spanish mission,
San Juan Bautista
it's called, and
it's been preserved
exactly as it was
100 years ago,
as a museum.
Now, think hard,
darling. Think hard.
You've been there before.
You've seen it.
No, no, I've never...
I've never been there.
Oh, Scottie, what is it?
I've never been there.
Think hard. Now go on
about your dream.

Shot :642


Shot :643


Shot :644


Shot :645


Shot :646


Shot :647
Oh, you're going to be
all right now, Madeleine.
Don't you see?
You've given me
something to work on now.
I'm going to take you
down there to that mission,
this afternoon.
And when you see it,
you'll remember
when you saw it before,
and it'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it.
I promise you. All right?

Shot :648
Come on now.
I'll take you home.
No. I'll be all right.
You come back here
around noon.

Shot :649


Shot :650


Shot :651


Shot :652

Shot :655


Shot :656


Shot :657


Shot :658


Shot :659
Here with you.
And it's all real.
It's not merely
as it was 100 years ago,
or a year ago,
or six months ago,
or whenever it was
you were here to see it.
Now, Madeleine,
think of when
you were here.
There were not
so many carriages then.
There were horses
in the stalls.
A bay, two black
and a gray.
It was our favorite place.
But we were forbidden
to play here.
Sister Teresa
would scold us.

Shot :660
Look at this.
Well, here's your gray horse.
Have a little trouble getting
in and out of the stall
without being pushed,
but even so...

Shot :661


Shot :662
Madeleine, try.

Shot :663
Try for me.

Shot :664
I love you, Madeleine.
I love you, too.
Too late. Too late.
No, no, we're together.
No, it's too late.
There's something
I must do.
No. There's nothing
you must do.
There's nothing
you must do.
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

Shot :665


Shot :666


Shot :667


Shot :668


Shot :669


Shot :670
Look. It's not fair.
It's too late.
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.
It shouldn't have happened.
It had to happen.
We're in love.
That's all that counts.

Shot :671


Shot :672


Shot :673


Shot :674
Yes.
And if you lose me,
then you'll know I...

Ferguson.

Shot :717
took the preliminary
precaution of having her
watched by Mr. Ferguson,
lest any harm befall her.

Shot :718
to take his wife
to an institution,

Shot :719
Mr. Ferguson,
being an ex-detective,

Shot :720


Shot :721


Shot :722
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care was due

Shot :723


Shot :724


Shot :725


Shot :726


Shot :727
As to Mr. Ferguson,

Shot :728
from that great city
to the north,

Shot :729
testify as to his
character and ability.

Shot :730
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances,

Shot :731


Shot :732


Shot :733
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated

Shot :734


Shot :735
It is a pity that knowing
her suicidal tendencies,

Shot :736
But we are not here
to pass judgment
on Mr. Ferguson's
lack of initiative.
He did nothing.

Shot :737
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall

Shot :738


Shot :739


Shot :740
until he found himself
back in his own apartment
in San Francisco

Shot :741


Shot :742


Shot :743
he could not face
the tragic result
of his own weakness

Shot :744
That has nothing to do
with your verdict.
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

Shot :745
Now, from the evidence
of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster

Shot :746


Shot :747


Shot :748


Shot :749
You may retire if you wish.
Hold on, Mr. Jones.

Shot :750


Shot :751


Shot :752


Shot :753


Shot :754
Thank you.

Shot :755


Shot :756


Shot :757
All right, Scottie,
let's go.
Mind if I speak to him
for a minute?
No, go ahead.
Scottie.
Sorry, Scottie.
That was rough.
He had no right
to speak to you
like that.
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have
got you involved.
No, there's nothing
you have to say to me.
I'm getting out,
Scottie, for good.
I can't stay here.
I'm going to wind up
her affairs and mine,
get away as far as I can.
Europe, perhaps.
And I probably never
will come back.
Good-bye, Scottie.
If there's anything
I can do for you
before I go.
There was no way
for them to understand.
You and I know
who killed Madeleine.

It's Mozart,
Wolfgang Amadeus.
I had a long talk
with that lady
in musical therapy, Johnny,

Shot :805


Shot :806


Shot :807


Shot :808
You know, it's wonderful

You're not lost.
Mother is here.

Shot :817


Shot :818
Okay.
I'll be in again, John.
You want me
to shut that off?
Oh, John-O.
You don't even know
I'm here, do you?
But I'm here.

Shot :819


Shot :820
Doctor, Miss Wood.
Won't you go in, please?
Yes, Miss Wood?
Doctor, how long is it
going to take you
to pull him out of this?
Well, it's hard to say.
At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

Shot :821
He won't talk.

Shot :822
No. He's suffering
from acute melancholia,
together with
a guilt complex.
He blames himself
for what happened
to the woman.

Shot :823


Shot :824


Shot :825
I can give you
another complication,

The poor thing.
I didn't know her.
Tell me, is it true

What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson.

Shot :875
Oh, no.
There are just couple
of things I'd like to ask.
You live in this hotel?

Shot :876
Yeah, I thought so.
A pickup.

Shot :877
Now, you beat it.
Go on and beat it.

Shot :878
Listen, I'm gonna
yell in a minute.

Shot :879


Shot :880


Shot :881
Why?

Shot :882


Shot :883


Shot :884
but then she ditched you
for another guy,

Shot :885
Then you saw me
and something clicked.

Shot :886
Well, it's not gonna work,
so you better go.

Shot :887


Shot :888


Shot :889
Now, you won't have to.
Well, you don't look very
much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?
I want to know
your name.
Judy Barton.
Who you are?
I'm just a girl.
I work at Magnin's.

Shot :890
It's a place to live,
that's all.
No, but you haven't
lived here long?

Shot :891


Shot :892
Salina, Kansas.

Shot :893


Shot :894


Shot :895


Shot :896
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.
I work at Magnin's,
and I live here.

Shot :897


Shot :898
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.
Judy Barton,
number Z296794,
425 Maple Avenue,
Salina, Kansas.
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.
A California license
issued May 25, 1954.
You want to check
my thumbprints?
You satisfied?
And whether you're
satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.
Gee, you have got it bad,
haven't you?

Shot :899


Shot :900


Shot :901


Shot :902


Shot :903
Yes, that's me
with my mother.

Shot :904
My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy,
so I decided
I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.
I've been here three years.
Honest.

Shot :905


Shot :906
Why?

Shot :907


Shot :908


Shot :909
Dinner and what else?
Just dinner.

Shot :910


Shot :911
Well, I've been
on blind dates before.

Shot :912


Shot :913


Shot :914
Okay.

Shot :915

Shot :934
Dearest Scottie.
And so you found me.
This is the moment that
I dreaded and hoped for.

Shot :935


Shot :936
I wanted so
to see you again,
just once.
Now I'll go,
and you can give up
your search.
I want you to have
peace of mind.
You've nothing
to blame yourself for.
You were the victim.
I was the tool, and you were
the victim of Gavin Elster's
plan to murder his wife.
He chose me to play the part
because I looked like her.
He dressed me up like her.
It was quite safe because
she lived in the country
and rarely came to town.
He chose you
to be the witness
to a suicide.
The Carlotta story
was part real,
part invented,
to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted
to kill herself.
He knew of your illness.
He knew you'd never get up
the stairs to the tower.
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.
I made the mistake.
I fell in love.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.
If I had the nerve,
I'd stay and lie,
hoping that I could make
you love me again
as I am for myself.
And so forget the other
and forget the past.
But I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.

Shot :937


Shot :938


Shot :939


Shot :940


Shot :941


Shot :942


Shot :943


Shot :944
Oh, here.
Here, I'll do it.
There you are.
Thanks again.
Good night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well...
No, I mean
tomorrow morning.
But I have to go to work.
I've got a job.
Don't go to your job.
And what'll I live on?
My oil wells in Texas?
Let me take care
of you, Judy.

Shot :945
No, Judy,
you don't understand.
Oh, I understand,
all right.
I've been understanding
since I was 17.
And the next step is?
No, no. No, no.

Shot :946
We could just see
a lot of each other.

Shot :947
Why?

Shot :948


Shot :949


Shot :950


Shot :951


Shot :952
And nothing else?

Shot :953
No.

Shot :954


Shot :955


Shot :956


Shot :957


Shot :958

Shot :961


Shot :962


Shot :963


Shot :964


Shot :965
There you are.
I like that one.
Like that?
Yes.
All right.
Well, that's very nice.
It's beautiful.
There we are.
Now, we'll get this,
and then we'll buy you
those clothes.
Honest?
Right over there's
Ransohoffs.
It's the best.
How much is that?
That'll be 50 cents.
Thank you.
Scottie,
you don't have to.
But I want to.

Shot :966


Shot :967


Shot :968
No, that's not it.
Nothing like it.

Shot :969
Now, look. I just want an ordinary,
simple gray suit.
But I like
that one, Scottie.
No, no.
It's not right.
Gentleman seems
to know what he wants.
All right. We'll find it.

Shot :970


Shot :971
Scottie, what
are you doing?
I'm trying
to buy you a suit.
But... But I love the
second one she wore.
And this one,
it's beautiful.

Shot :972


Shot :973


Shot :974


Shot :975
Thank you.
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.
You want me to be
dressed like her.
Judy, I just want you
to look nice.

Shot :976


Shot :977


Shot :978


Shot :979
Judy.

Shot :980


Shot :981
No, I don't want any clothes.
I don't want anything.
I want to get out of here.
Judy, do this
for me.

Shot :982


Shot :983
I thought so.
I don't like it.
No, we'll take it.
Will the thing fit?

Shot :984


Shot :985
How long will the
alterations take?
Well...
May we have it
by tonight?
Well, if it's
absolutely necessary.
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like
to look at a dinner dress,
an evening dress.
Short, black, with
long sleeves, and
a kind of square neck.
Scottie!

Shot :986


Shot :987
All right. That's it.
Do you have them in brown?
Yes, we have.
Fine.
Here, Judy.
Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.
Stop.
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
No good, I guess.
I don't know.
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.
You can, you know.
No. You wouldn't let me.
And I don't wanna go.
Oh, Judy. Judy,
I tell you this.
These past few days have
been the first happy days
I've known in a year.
I know. I know because...

Shot :988


Shot :989
No. No, Judy.
Judy, it's you, too.
There's something
in you that...
You don't even want
to touch me.

Shot :990
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?
When we first started out,
it was so good. We had fun.
And... And then
you started in
on the clothes.
Well, I'll wear
the darned clothes
if you want me to,
if you'll just like me.

Shot :991
Oh, no.

Shot :992


Shot :993


Shot :994


Shot :995
If...

Shot :996


Shot :997


Shot :998
will you love me?

Shot :999
Yes.
All right.
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.
Here, come on.
We'll sit by the fire.
I'm afraid it's going
to take several hours.
The young lady
thought perhaps
you'd like to go home.
And then she'll come there
as soon as she's finished.
Well, no. You tell her
I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.
Oh, and you're sure
about the color
of the hair?
Oh, yes.
It's an easy color.
And all the rest of...
Yes, sir, we know
what you want.
Thank you.

Shot :1008


Shot :1009


Shot :1010


Shot :1011
Well?
It should be back
from your face and
pinned at the neck.
I told her that.
I told you that.
We tried it.
It just didn't seem
to suit me.
Please, Judy.

Shot :1012

Shot :1022
Where shall
we go for dinner?
Anywhere you like.
Ernie's?
You have a thing
about Ernie's, don't you?
Well, after all,
it's our place.
Hello, my love.
Like me?
Mmm-hmm.

Shot :1023


Shot :1024
Come here.

Shot :1025


Shot :1026


Shot :1027


Shot :1028


Shot :1029


Shot :1030
I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna have
one of those big,
beautiful steaks.
Let me see.
To start,
I think I'll...

Shot :1031


Shot :1032
I have it.
How do you work
this thing?
Can't you see?
Oh. Now,
there you are.
Thank you.
I'm just about ready.

Shot :1033


Shot :1034
Where did I put it?
I had it a minute ago.
I wonder if it's here.
Here it is.

Shot :1035
There, I'm ready.
But first,
muss me a little?
Scottie, I do
have you now, don't I?
How would you like
to go someplace
out of town for dinner?
Maybe we could drive
down the peninsula.
All right. If you'd like.

Shot :1036
We're going awfully far.
I just feel like driving.
You terribly hungry?
No. No, it's all right.

Shot :1037


Shot :1038


Shot :1039


Shot :1040
Where're you going?

Shot :1041


Shot :1042


Shot :1043


Shot :1044
Scottie, why are we here?

Shot :1045
I have to go back
into the past once more.

Shot :1046
Why? Why here?
Madeleine died here, Judy.
I don't wanna go.
I'd rather wait here.
No, I need you.
Why?
I need you to be
Madeleine for a while.
And when it's done,
we'll both be free.
I'm scared.
Oh, no. I have to tell
you about Madeleine now.

Shot :1047


Shot :1048
And she said,
"If you lose me,
"you'll know that
I loved you..."
Scottie.
"...and wanted to
keep on loving you."
And I said,
"I won't lose you."
But I did.

Shot :1049


Shot :1050
and ran into the church.

Shot :1051
And when I followed her,
it was too late.
I don't wanna go in there!
It's too late.

Shot :1052
Scottie, I...

Shot :1053


Shot :1054
She was running
up the tower.
Right here.
Scottie...
See? She was running
up the stairs,
through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.
And I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.
I tried,
but I couldn't
get to the top.
One doesn't often
get a second chance.
I want to stop
being haunted.

Shot :1055
Take me away!
You look like
Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

Shot :1056


Shot :1057


Shot :1058


Shot :1059
Go up the stairs, Judy.
And I'll follow.

Shot :1060


Shot :1061


Shot :1062


Shot :1063


Shot :1064


Shot :1065


Shot :1066


Shot :1067


Shot :1068


Shot :1069


Shot :1070
This was as far
as I could get,
but you went on.
Remember?
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.
I remembered the necklace.
Let me go!
No. We're going up
the tower, Madeleine.
You can't!
You're afraid!
Now, we'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.
Scottie, please!
But you knew that day
that I wouldn't be able
to follow you, didn't you?
Who was up there
when you got up there?
Elster and his wife?
Yes.
Yes, and she was
the one who died.
The real wife, not you.
You were the copy.
You were the counterfeit,
weren't you?
Was she dead or alive when...
Dead! Dead!
He'd broken her neck.
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances,
was he?
So, when you got up there,
he pushed her off the tower,
but it was you
that screamed.
Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it,
Scottie. I ran up
to stop it. I...
If you wanted to stop it,
why did you scream,
since you tricked me
so well up to then?
You played the wife
very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?
He made you over
just like I made you
over, only better.
Not only the clothes
and the hair,
but the looks,
and the manner,
and the words,
and those beautiful
phony trances.
And you jumped into
the Bay, didn't you?
I'll bet you're
a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you? Aren't you?
Aren't you?
Yes!
And then what did he do?
Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?
Did he tell you exactly
what to do, what to say?
You were a very apt pupil,
too, weren't you?
You were a very apt pupil.

Shot :1071


Shot :1072


Shot :1073
I was the setup,
wasn't I?
I was the setup.
I was a made-to-order
witness. I...
I made it.
I made it.
What are you going to do?
We're going up
and look at the
scene of the crime.
Come on, Judy.

Shot :1074


Shot :1075
And this is
where it happened.
And the two of you
hid back there
and waited for it to clear,
and then you sneaked down
and drove into town,
is that it?
And then?
You were his girl?
